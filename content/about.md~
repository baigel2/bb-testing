Hi, 

I'm Adnan. 
this is a test.
I hate the way websites and blogs for too long have been more add than material.

I wanted to make a blog that makes you almost feel like your reading a book. I dont want to have thousands of adds all over the place so the most you'll see in my posts are either none, or one per post right at the very bottom after you've read the whole post.

I work in retail and then outside of work I work on me. On living and learning, progressing and getting up again every time I fail.

I write about literally anything that interests me including science, religion, self help & improvment, mental health, and as new topics take my interest moving forward you will see them represented in my posts.

## Publishing Schedule:

I will aim to publish one article a month, one poem a week and at the beginning of each week I will release 7 motivational quotes, 1 for each day of the week. 

## Quotes & Poems:

When I upload poetry or quotes, if you don't see a name after it that's one of mine. Otherwise I will put the authors name or, if the author is unknown then I will put - Unknown, at the end.

## Affiliate links:

Affiliate links are a great way to earn some passive income without any extra cost to the customers. When you click on an affiliate link and make a purchase, I will get a % of the sale without any extra cost to you.

It helps me out a great deal and I will never post links to random useless rubbish. Only things that are related to the article they are placed in and only things that provide you value somehow.

I will mention every time if a link is an affiliate link or not. The links to my social media accounts are not affiliate links.


## Socials:

Feel free to follow me on Instagram, Threads and Twitter. I post at least once a day in the morning with a motivational quote or a lesson I'm learning or have just learnt from life.

Links to my socials are just below and can also be found at the bottom of every blog post I write.

If you want daily motivation through example then head on over now.


## My first daily posts on socials:

Each morning I post my mini workout along with a motivational quote to start the day off. In the 2nd image of the post you'll see something like "P1 20, P2 20/40, P3 20/60." below the day and date. This is for convenience on my part but here's what it means.

* P = Push ups, x = set number. Therefore: P1 = my 1st set of push ups in the workout.

* xx = number of reps in the first set.

* xx/xx = number of reps this set/total number of reps for this (mini) workout so far.

The purpose of this workout is mainly just to help me wake my body and mind up and it's immediately followed by a mandatory cold shower just to give a little boost. No need for a coffee after that!
