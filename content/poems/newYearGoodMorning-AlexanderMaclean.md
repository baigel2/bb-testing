New Year, good-morning! Come and bring
Us days that smile and days that sing
Out from the drifts of swirling snow
That through the mirky midnight blow
And clutch with frosty hands and cling.

Hark! how the joy-bells chime and ring
Thy birth, and new hope set a-wing.
With hands outstretched you come; and so
New Year, good-morning!

New courage greets their clamoringâ€”
The thought of friends, the thought of spring,
Of kindly solace for our woe,
Of happiness we're still to know;
We wait your accolade, O King!
New Year, good-morning!
