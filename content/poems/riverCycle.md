The endless way the river flows.

In circles it cycles, it comes and it goes.

Life is like a river, to go from the clouds, to the mountains to the dirt,

then back up and on again,

if you don't let it, it wont hurt.

Strengthen your mind, it's about the way you take what comes.

Let no errors break you,

but let them teach you more.

Forward is the way I go, for forward is the way I must,

and as I go, I'm back again,

a new beginning born,

from a previous end.
