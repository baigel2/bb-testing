## Introducing short stories! :D

I've wanted to be an author for as long as I could remember and have started many writing projects over the years but everytime I started writing a book, eventually I gave up or moved on.

A few months ago I decided I would overcoome this by just getting something published even if it's small and not that good.

I am happy to say that I fianally managed to do this and have self published my first poetry book on Amazon. Now I'm working on three more books 2 non fiction and 1 fiction.

In the interest of developoing the necasary skills to write great stories I'm going to need to read and write many over the coming months and years which is why I made this page.

It will follow the same standard as my other pages for poems and quotes where I will cite the author or put unknown and if no author is cited then that story is one of mine.

If you want to read my poetry book 'The Wanderer' It's available [here](https://mybook.to/tisL3) on Amazon exclusively. (If the link doesn't work just search Amazon for 'The Wanderer Adnan Baig' and it should come up).

50% of profits go directly to charity (25% to Palestine & 25% to the Uhygur Muslims) and a further 25% goes to other projects I'm working on to help raise more money for people in need.

The book is priced at Â£1.99 but if you have kindle unlimeted it is free for you to read and then I'll get paid based on how many pages are read.
