## First, an introduction to the series. Wisdom of the ages:

> **“Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.”** - Winston Churchill.

This is true, not just for societies and cultures at large, across centuries and millennia, but across decades, years, months and days in and throughout our own individual lives.

If you fail to learn from the mistakes of your past, you will keep repeating them and they will, time and time again, halt your progress forward, upwards, to becoming a better version of yourself.

The great thing about the ancient times is, how similar they were to our times. Sure, they may not have had the internet, computers, television or even electricity, but the human mind hasn’t changed so much in the last few thousand years.

Societies and individuals today still struggle with frighteningly similar problems to the ones faced by people thousands of years in the past and across multiple civilisations around the world.

In this series, I will attempt to uncover the people, traditions, philosophies and ultimately solutions to the key problems people face today that the philosophers, sages, warriors, kings and pheasants figured out in eon’s past.

As you read through the articles I will post in this series you might, like me, be surprised at just how similar the lives of these ancient seekers of wisdom were to ours and how much more extreme their situations sometimes were.

Captivate your imagination and learn from the records of history as you take this journey with me, exploring the wisdom of the ages.

# Jesus Christ - The most influential person to ever walk the earth.

## Merry Christmas!

And I mean Merry Christmas! If you want the right to call yours Eid, Diwali, Hanukkah etc then you will call Christmas, Christmas. 

## Jesus Christ.

The most influential person the world has ever known and had the privilege of learning from, taught so much in such a short span of time and left such an impression on so many that more than two thousand years later the whole world still celebrates Him at least twice a year. What a man! To Christians around the world, far more than just a man.

The principles, philosophies and wisdom Jesus Christ brought to the world forever changed the course of history. So, what is it that he taught? What is it that we can learn from the life of Jesus?

That’s what I’ll be focusing on in this post. The things that Jesus taught that you can apply today to improve your life even if only by a little. So, lets get started!

## Love, the highest of all virtues.

*“Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. “But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you”* - (Matthew 5:43–44)

Nothing comes before Love. Nothing. Love is the highest, and sometimes the hardest of all virtues. Why was such an emphasis put on this, even to the extent of loving the very people who crucified Him?

Simple: God IS Love.

That’s why nothing is more important. Even in death, Jesus showed Love and asked The Father to forgive the very people who were crucifying Him! How many of us could do that? How many of us show love to each other? To the person holding up traffic in the morning when you’re trying to get to work. How many of us show Love and Jesus level patience to our partners, our siblings, our parents, our children?

Love, is the hardest of all virtues, it encompasses all others. Love is what allows mothers of all species to risk their own lives for the sake of their children and soildiers in battle for the sake of their brothers and their countries. Love is what propels someone to improve themselves and grow instead of recede into the living death of despair and depression.

It’s what causes you to see that you need to improve and learn and grow in the first place. What makes you think about people other than just you. Love is both self caring and self less. It multiplies the more it is shared and when not abused can only make the world better.

It’s the thing that allows people to see each others humanity, to see each others similarities before our differences but also to see, acknowledge and respect that we’re all unique and have our own lives and ways of doing things.

I’m reminded of a quote that is mentioned in various religions if a little paraphrased: 

“All rivers lead to the same Ocean.”

Or in other words, all paths lead to the same Source of life.

Without Love, there would be nothing. Love is the root of all good things and the fabric of the universe and reality itself. If you learn or remember one thing from this article and from Christianity, remember this: Jesus loved you so much, He thought you were worth dying for, and then He did.

He thought your loved ones, your best friends and greatest enemies, your coworkers, the random people you see out in the world as you go about your day, the people at the bottom and the people at the top of society, good, bad, ugly, beautiful, were all so valuable they were worth dying for.

That's what gives Christians the edge over all others. There's no way to be more loving than that. Regardless of your own religious affiliation or even if you're not religious, if you go about your day with this perspective in your mind even if you don’t believe it literally happened, it's almost impossible not to care at least a little more about others.

## The Golden Rule: Treating people how you would have them treat you.

*“32 “If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. 33 And if you do good to those who are
good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that.
34 And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that> to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.
35 But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.
36 Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.”* - Luke 6:33

It’s very common these days, almost a societal requirement; to treat people how they treat you. But Ghandi wasn’t the only person who knew an eye for an eye mentality helps no one in the long run. When people treat others how they themselves would like to be treated, it forces people to think about others.

I should treat them how I would want them to treat me. It’s easier said than done but I think for the most part and in most cases, the effort is worth it. It shows a great deal of wisdom on the part of Jesus because in a way, it uses people’s tendency to think of themselves first, to cultivate empathy.

By thinking about themselves a little (by thinking about how they would like to be treated), people end up treating others with more kindness and patience. If more people adopted this mindset, I think it would at least be possible for the world to become a slightly better place.
 
## There is a righteousness higher than lawfulness.

Sometimes doing what is right means departing from convention and corrupt laws. And no, this is not me telling you to go rob a bank so don’t even think about it!

Jesus was often approached and questioned by the Rabbi’s of His time, often in a effort to catch Him out and make Him say or do something against the law. Jesus, unfazed would repeatedly explain and often demonstrate that simply following the law does not always mean you are doing the right thing.

Sometimes the most righteous action is the one that goes directly against the law.

*“12 At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them. 2 When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.”
3 He answered, “Haven’t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? 4 He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread—which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests. 5 Or haven’t you read in the Law that the priests on Sabbath duty in the temple desecrate the Sabbath and yet are innocent? 6 I tell you that something greater than the temple is here. 7 If you had known what these words mean, ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice,’[a] you would not have condemned the innocent. 8 For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”* – NIV Matthew 12

It is a personal believe of mine that, more deeply than the writings in any holy book, God has written right and wrong into our very hearts and souls. The thing we call conscience, which let’s us know when we are or are not on the right track. I think the conscience is aligned with God and His will and living in alignment with that will help to make us better versions of ourselves.
 
## Look at yourself first before you judge others.

*"Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.
And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?”* - Matthew 7 KJV

This is one lesson from the teachings of Jesus Christ that I will keep with me for the rest of my life. It’s easier read than practiced, however. Humans are so quick to judge these days especially online. But how you judge others often says quite a lot more about you than who you’re judging.

The only way you can truly, fairly judge a person is if you truly 100% completely know them. This, however, is impossible. There are still things about myself that I am learning now that I didn’t know before and so if even, I don’t know myself literally 100% then how can anyone else? No, only God can know me completely and so only God can judge me with complete fairness. I have no right to judge the fates of others and other people have no right to assume mine either.

This is also something that is mentioned in multiple religions and is something worth remembering the next time you find yourself condemning someone to an afterlife you wouldn’t want for yourself.

## Forgiveness.

When it comes to forgiveness in religion, and this extends to good deeds in general, there seems to be two perspective about the matter.

1.	Be merciful to others and God will be merciful to you.
2.	Forgiving others help both parties heal and form better relationships.

I don’t like the first one. It’s something that I’ve seen in more than one religion. Be good to others in the hope that it will cause God to be good to you on judgment day. Human beings have a selfish nature, I can accept that, but this is too selfish. That part of religion that tries to make a currency out of deeds, I hate it.

You can’t buy your way into heaven. The ONLY way you get there is by Gods will and Mercy, by Gods Love. That’s it. Regardless of all other variables if God says you’re in you’re in, and if God says you’re out, you are out, it’s that simple. 

If God wanted to put all the prophets, saints and kind hearted people in hell and all the demons, devils and satan himself in heaven He has the complete authority and ability to do just that. I’m not saying that’s what He is going to do, just that He could.

We do not decide where we go after we die, God does. We decide how we live in this life and how we treat others. The rest is up to God. Making a currency out of deeds turns virtues into greed. The primary purpose of good deeds is to clean and purify the heart and to help people improve themselves and their relationships with each other. It’s how we make the world a better place or at least how we could.

I think this is the real reason religions and Jesus talk about forgiveness. Not so we can use it to purchase a seat in heaven but so that we can improve ourselves, clean out hearts and souls and thereby foster better relationships with others and hopefully improve the world – hopefully.

## In conclusion:

Align yourself with your conscience and let that be your guide. That’s your connection to God, your umbilical cord to The Source of life itself. Forgive, Love and do not judge (unless you’re a judge in a court of law), look at yourself and where you can improve before you start telling everybody else to.

I think regardless of whether you are religious or not there is a great deal you can learn from the wisdom of Jesus Christ recorded in the writings of Christianity just as we can learn a great deal from the writings of any religion. It’s one of the reasons I think religious texts survive for so long, because of the value they provide in trying to help people become better versions of themselves and that to me, is what this life is all about.
