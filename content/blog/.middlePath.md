The alarm goes off and you leap out of bed turning it off mid flight. Your towel is hanging ready and you head into the shower to start your day with a 0 kelvin shower. No breakfast. Food is for cowards. Your food must be earned with blood sweat and pushups.

Am I sounding Gogginsey yet?

Thing is, if you're the most disciplined person in the world for just one day it won't make a difference. Towards the end of 2022 I gave myself a 100 day discipline challenge. I exercised and maintained more discipline over the course of that experiment than I ever had before.

I experimented with how much less sleep I could get and still function eventually getting up at 2:30am about 6 days a week. I allowed myself no junk food, no takeaways, no games.

You know how long it took me to return to lazieness afterwards? Like a week at most!

Consistency is more important than intensity. If you go at 80% for a year you will achieve more than if you go at 150% for a week.

Discipline equals freedom.
It's the hard way or no way.
No more fucking excuses!

There's a lot of people on social media who say things like this and seem to believe that the only way to achieve anything at all is by way of extreme dedication and discipline. That there are only two paths in life, success through pain and suffering, or failure through ease and comfort.

Sure, a lot of these people have achieved a great deal more than most ever will and at least on the surface level it seems like their methods and philosophies have merit; but is it really true that their way is the **only** way to succeed in life?

Without even playing around with the a definition of success and just using their definition which ultimately boils down to one thing, freedom; is endless hard work, and toiling and suffering and grinding really the **only** way to achieve success?

Why grind when you can sail?
