A little about the series:

Everything that exists, had a beginning. I wonder, what was the beginning of music? It's history predates writing and it's influence is capable of creating phisical and phsychological changes in the the mind soul and body. Music can make you laugh, cry, rage, dream, focus, relax and bounce around like a donkey on crack.

So where did it come from?

You wanna know something crazy? It even predates humans. Don't believe me?

**Birdsongs.**

Birds have been around since the dinosaurs. That's at least 65 million years.

Ok, so when did we start using it and how did we get to all the infinite awesomeness we hear today?

That's what this series is all about so if that sounds like something you'd be interested in just read on.

Part 1?

# Origin.

**Where did (Human) Music come from?**

Before we look at the research lets think about it for a moment. You're an early human living in Africa it's sunrise and you're woken up by your iphon... sorry I mean bird songs on your iphon... fuck, sorry about this. Birdsongs. You're woken up by birds singing in the trees abouve your camp.

You look up and see the trees and the beautiful sky. You look out into the savanah and think about what the day might bring. You need to find food. If your a male you'll need to hunt, if your a female you'd more likely forage. What thoughts might have gone through the mind of people like that?

Would the female you have started humming the birdsongs, or might you have accidentaly breathed out with your lips slightly open and discovered whistling?

Maybe you teach this new sound to your family and the men think about using it for hunting to confuse their prey?

Mabye as a right of passage into adulthood the men have to be able to mimic the sounds of animals the like to hunt and others then need to avoid.

Maybe music, predates language!


I'm just guessing here so none of this might actually be how it happened.


Homo Sapiens (Me and you) as a species thought to be around 300,000 years old. There were other species of humans that predated and coexisted with us like the world famous Neandertals for example and I'm willing to bet that they may also have used sound in a similar fashion.

The oldest archaeological evidence of music we have at the moment comes in the form of bone flutes in caves in Germany dated roughly over 43,000 years old. But being able to make a functioning musical instrument requires prior knowlege of many key principles and an idea of what you want the instrument to sound like before hand.


They must have had music well before they started making instruments.


As far as I can see though the caves in Germany are about as far back as the reasearch goes. So what's the next milestone?


# Tribal Music.

Music for hunting, music for war, music for weddings, for just about anything you can think of I'm guessing.
