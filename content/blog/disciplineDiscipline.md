Discipline. Many people have a romantic idea of discipline. The warriors path. Overcome the self. Constantly at war, swimming against the currents, pushing back against the winds. Diving head first into the waters of discomfort.

Is that the only way? Is that the only way to progress in life? By Grinding? Is it not possible to sail?

What if it is?

Do I have to be the next Jockko or Goggins? NO! In fact, that's about the dumbest idea I could ever possibly have! Goggins is Goggins, Jockko is Jockko and God made me Adnan.

And in writing, I think I've finally found my calling.

I don't have to do 50,000 push ups a day and run 10 ultramarathons an hour 25 days a week. I don't have to hold my breath as I freedive to the bottom of the mariana trench.

Discipline has it's place and I will use it as I need to but it doesn't need to become my life or yours.

You don't have to be the next Goggins. Just be the first you!

I have plenty of flaws. Everyone has flaws. They are gifts, because in overcoming them we grow and become our truest selves.

I have much to learn, MANY flaws to overcome, and a very long way to go before I get to where I want to be in life but one thing is for sure: If I don't get up everytime I fall, I'm guaranteed to fail. If I do, eventually the win will come, and I only need to win big, once.

Find your calling. The reason why God put you on this earth. The superpowers He gave you. The things that you're naturally good at and that you love to do. It's ok if you're not the best and no matter what you do there will always be aspects that challenge you.

But the growth is in the challenges.

Step outside your comfort zone just enough to grow a little, and become your truest self.

Follow your heart and soul.
