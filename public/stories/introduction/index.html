<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to be an author for as long as I could remember and have started many writing projects over the years but everytime I started writing a book, eventually I gave up or moved on.</p>
<p>A few months ago I decided I would overcoome this by just getting something published even if it&rsquo;s small and not that good.</p>
<p>I am happy to say that I fianally managed to do this and have self published my first poetry book on Amazon. Now I&rsquo;m working on three more books 2 non fiction and 1 fiction.</p>
<p>In the interest of developoing the necasary skills to write great stories I&rsquo;m going to need to read and write many over the coming months and years which is why I made this page.</p>
<p>It will follow the same standard as my other pages for poems and quotes where I will cite the author or put unknown and if no author is cited then that story is one of mine.</p>
<p>If you want to read my poetry book &lsquo;The Wanderer&rsquo; It&rsquo;s available <a href="https://mybook.to/tisL3">here</a> on Amazon exclusively. (If the link doesn&rsquo;t work just search Amazon for &lsquo;The Wanderer Adnan Baig&rsquo; and it should come up).</p>
<p>50% of profits go directly to charity (25% to Palestine &amp; 25% to the Uhygur Muslims) and a further 25% goes to other projects I&rsquo;m working on to help raise more money for people in need.</p>
<p>The book is priced at £1.99 but if you have kindle unlimeted it is free for you to read and then I&rsquo;ll get paid based on how many pages are read.</p>
