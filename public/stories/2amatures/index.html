<p>&ldquo;Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  Tom sighs. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be 6 months tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;ll bail us out again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know it&rsquo;s a he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, I suppose I am guessing. Do you think it&rsquo;s happening though?&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;No idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened the last 2 times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  Tom sighs again. &ldquo;That it did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&hellip; we&rsquo;re getting out right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hold your breath kid, two hundred thousand is a heck of a lot more money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah but, we can hope. Right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  Tom takes a breath, looks at the ground and nods slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s settled. We&rsquo;re getting out tomorrow, good things really do come in threes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll only be more dissapointed if you&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you think it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;Your guess is as good as mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  Tom looks James dead in the eyes. He knows whats coming. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, what if&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;Drop it! I told you it aint Dad alright! He&rsquo;s locked up just like we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James looks down at the floor pouting like a child. &ldquo;Dad wouldn&rsquo;t have got us in here in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;JIM SHUT UP!! Stop talking about him you don&rsquo;t know him like I did you&rsquo;re too young! You drop this now or I&rsquo;ll leave you on the yard on your own, see how long you last then! Got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just cause I&rsquo;m not strong like you doesn&rsquo;t mean I can&rsquo;t look after myself. I&rsquo;m smarter than you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  Tom calms himself down and takes a deep sigh. &ldquo;Nah kid, you&rsquo;re not smart. Smart kid wouldn&rsquo;t a stuck around with a big lump like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re brothers Tom. Brothers stick together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  Tom smiles and laughs a little inside, shaking his head. &ldquo;Shut up Jim. Get some sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two get to sleep and before long the bell rings and the cell doors open up. &ldquo;CHOW TIME YOU LAZY FUCKS!!&rdquo; Yells a guard as he drags his baton accross the cell bars making as much noise as he can.</p>
<p>                  Tom turns to his brother. &ldquo;Head down, say nothing. In and out quick as you can, got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>James nods his head anxiously and the two leave their cell for the food hall.</p>
<p>As the two make their way to the serving counter James hears another prisoner calling him from one of the tables and looks up. &ldquo;Hey sweetie, why don&rsquo;t you come here a minute.&rdquo; the man says with a grin.</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;Jim! I told you, keep your head down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aww what? You can&rsquo;t share? That&rsquo;s not nice!&rdquo; Shouts the prisoner at Tom.</p>
<p>The two keep their heads down and keep on walking till they arrive at the counter.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;HEY! I&rsquo;m talkin to you! and I&rsquo;m not the guy you wanna ignore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;Tom, he&rsquo;s gonna come over if we keep ignoring him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll all come over if we don&rsquo;t. Just get your food and lets eat and get back to the cell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming over Tom! Whata we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom grabs his butter knife and hides it in his hand. Then he steps in between James and the approaching prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I SAID. I&rsquo;m not the guy you wanna ignore you piece of shit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prisoner takes a swing at Tom who quickly ducks under while placing the butter knife at the prisoners throat. The prisoners face turns pale as Tom looks him dead in the eye&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;You leave us alone&hellip; We leave you alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prisoner says nothing. Tom waits a minute their eyes still locked together. Then he pulls back the knife slowly and waits for the prisoners next move.</p>
<p>The prisoner says nothing, scrunches up his face and goes back to his table.</p>
<p>                  Tom turns around to James. &ldquo;Eat your damn food and lets go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>James doesn&rsquo;t say anything either. He knows how much worse it could have gone. The two eat their food and go back to their cell.</p>
<p>Not much time passes before a guard comes up to their cell. He doesn&rsquo;t say anything at first. He just stares at them and ponders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two must give the best God damn head in the state for someone to think you&rsquo;re worth that much money! Two hundred thousand dollars! Phew!&rdquo; Whistles the guard.</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;I told you we&rsquo;re geting out Tom! Didn&rsquo;t I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grab our shit. Lets go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither of the two waste any time and the guard takes them to be processed out.</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not worried.&rdquo; says the guard, handing Tom his car keys. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be back in a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two tops.&rdquo; Says another guard behind the glass.</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;Try not to get arrested before you leave the carpark ok boys, surely you can manage that can&rsquo;t ya?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither Tom or James say a word. They just head out to the carpark to their car. As soon as they do though they see that all the tyres have been punctured. The hood is up and the battery has been thrown through the windshield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahh Fuck!&rdquo; Shouts Tom.</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;What! Those bastards!! Those God damn bastards!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck it, we&rsquo;ll walk. They did that on purpose just to get a reaction. Sick fucks are probably laughing at us right now. Let go get something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two walk into town and with only $5 between them they get a burger and split it in half. Tom gives James the bigger half.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to find some place to sleep tonight.&rdquo; Says Tom.</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;I liked the car. It used to feel safe in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, you wanna go back to the carpark? We can&rsquo;t steal another one this soon, they&rsquo;ll know it was us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;What about the train bridge? we can take those boxes over there with us to keep warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pair take the boxes and get to the nearby train bridge.</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;Tom look. There&rsquo;s a hole in the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s small. We could probably squeeze in though. Here, put the cardboard on the ground it so doesn&rsquo;t take our heat. I&rsquo;ll take the bag outta that trash can we&rsquo;ll use it as a blanket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They squeeze in carefully. It&rsquo;s a tight fit but ther&rsquo;es just enough room to breath at least.</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold Tom. So freakin cold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know Jim. It&rsquo;ll be alright. We&rsquo;ll figure it out. Lets get some rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t get much sleep. They spend most of the night shivering. Worse still, when they wake up they&rsquo;re soaking wet!</p>
