<p>The two would be robbers, Tom and James, pull up in their car right outside the bank. This isn&rsquo;t their first time but, it might as well be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok, guns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;Got em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bags?&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;Them too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gloves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;On.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Lets go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;Right&hellip; Wait Tom!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;Masks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit! We&rsquo;re not goin back to jail again, fuck that, here&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both put their masks on and then get out of their car and start making their way to the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;What now!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Door wont shut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;Jim, how dumb are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t shut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;Who cares lets go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if somebody steals the car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom lets out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look it wont close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;How many times have i told you, you have to&hellip; SEE you&rsquo;re not even pushing the handle down afterwards! WHy are you so stupid? It&rsquo;s right there you can see the handle is up just push it down for fuck sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;Alright, no need to get mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in the fucking bank now! Tom screams while pointing at the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two finally make their way into the bank and pull out their guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright everyone listen up! Everyone on the floor and nobody gets hurt. All we want is the money and then we&rsquo;re outa here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone gets on the ground quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; (Why are they so relaxed?) Tom thinks to himself. Then he notices a security guard not following instructions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I <strong>strongly</strong> sugguest you get on the ground, I&rsquo;m sure you have family you want to get back to. James, keep your gun aimed at him, I got a feeling he&rsquo;s gonna try something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;Tom! You used my name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck! Wait you idiot, you just used mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In all the confusion a man takes the opportunity to run at Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom! Look out!&rdquo; James takes his aim off the security guard to aim at the man. The security guard seeing his opportunity pulls out his tazer and shoots James.</p>
<p>James hasn&rsquo;t even hit the floor before the police arrive outside.</p>
<p>Tom looks at the police cars in awe. As the man takes him to the ground he doesn&rsquo;t even resist he just keeps looking at the police cars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did they get here so quick?&rdquo; He asks the man restraining him.</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;We could see you bickering outside so we told the bankers and they pushed the button under the counter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? There&rsquo;s a button under the counter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  The man looks confused. &ldquo;Yes, how could you not know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you there was a button Tom! You never listen!&rdquo; Screams James as the shock of the tazer wears off.</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;Tom?&rdquo; A police man says as he walks in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christ! Not Tom and Jerry again!&rdquo; Says another police man as he walks in.</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright guys it&rsquo;s just Tom and Jerry. Idiots actually tried robbing the same bank again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew that was their car outside. You two are as dumb as it gets! At least you parked on a different street last time. Haha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;We were in a rush!&rdquo; James whines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up Jim! Shouts Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The police men burst into laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ohh, Tom and Jerry. They aughta make a show outa you two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t just hurry up and arrest them could you.&rdquo; Says the man still restraining Tom. &ldquo;They have guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t worry sir they&rsquo;re no danger. We know these two all too well. They havent got enough money to buy real guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policeman bends down takes Toms gun and scratches some of the paint off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re just pellet guns painted black. They did the same thing last time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;And the time before that.&rdquo; Adds another policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright you two. Lets get you home.&rdquo; Says the policeman.</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re taking them home?&rdquo; Asks the man, confuzed as he hands Tom over to the policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prison sir. That&rsquo;s their home. Doesn&rsquo;t matter how many times they get out they always come right back. How long was it this time boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>                  &ldquo;About three weeks. Says one of the police men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, wow.&rdquo; Says the man. &ldquo;You two must be the dumbest bank robbers of all time. says the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The police take Tom and James to the station and lock them up. Before long they go to court and get three years.</p>
<p>Bail is $200,000.</p>
