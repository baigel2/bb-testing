      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I did not create jinn and humans except to worship Me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At first glance this seems like a very self centered, selfish statement. &amp;ldquo;Why is God so selfish?&amp;rdquo; a non believer might say. I certenly thought this when I was an atheist. And it does seem selfish until you do one of two things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Look at the very next few verses.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consider the nature and effects of what Allah defines as worship.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The verse above is &lt;a href=&#34;https://quran.com/en/adh-dhariyat/56-58&#34;&gt;Surah Adh-Dhariyat, verse 56&lt;/a&gt; if you look at verses 57 and 58 they read:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Discipline. Many people have a romantic idea of discipline. The warriors path. Overcome the self. Constantly at war, swimming against the currents, pushing back against the winds. Diving head first into the waters of discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is that the only way? Is that the only way to progress in life? By Grinding? Is it not possible to sail?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What if it is?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do I have to be the next Jockko or Goggins? NO! In fact, that&amp;rsquo;s about the dumbest idea I could ever possibly have! Goggins is Goggins, Jockko is Jockko and God made me Adnan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-i-love-apple-as-a-former-linux-user&#34;&gt;Why I love apple as a former linux user.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Linux. It&amp;rsquo;s an operating system I love very much. Or at least I love the idea of linux. The idea that you can own your computer and do whatever you want with it, change it completely to your liking and use it however you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a great idea in principle but there are some hangups. You see, theres a difference between being able to do everything yourself and having to do everything yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
