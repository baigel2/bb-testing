      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introducing-short-stories-d&#34;&gt;Introducing short stories! :D&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to be an author for as long as I could remember and have started many writing projects over the years but everytime I started writing a book, eventually I gave up or moved on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I decided I would overcoome this by just getting something published even if it&amp;rsquo;s small and not that good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am happy to say that I fianally managed to do this and have self published my first poetry book on Amazon. Now I&amp;rsquo;m working on three more books 2 non fiction and 1 fiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
