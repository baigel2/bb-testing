<p>Discipline. Many people have a romantic idea of discipline. The warriors path. Overcome the self. Constantly at war, swimming against the currents, pushing back against the winds. Diving head first into the waters of discomfort.</p>
<p>Is that the only way? Is that the only way to progress in life? By Grinding? Is it not possible to sail?</p>
<p>What if it is?</p>
<p>Do I have to be the next Jockko or Goggins? NO! In fact, that&rsquo;s about the dumbest idea I could ever possibly have! Goggins is Goggins, Jockko is Jockko and God made me Adnan.</p>
<p>And in writing, I think I&rsquo;ve finally found my calling.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to do 50,000 push ups a day and run 10 ultramarathons an hour 25 days a week. I don&rsquo;t have to hold my breath as I freedive to the bottom of the mariana trench.</p>
<p>Discipline has it&rsquo;s place and I will use it as I need to but it doesn&rsquo;t need to become my life or yours.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be the next Goggins. Just be the first you!</p>
<p>I have plenty of flaws. Everyone has flaws. They are gifts, because in overcoming them we grow and become our truest selves.</p>
<p>I have much to learn, MANY flaws to overcome, and a very long way to go before I get to where I want to be in life but one thing is for sure: If I don&rsquo;t get up everytime I fall, I&rsquo;m guaranteed to fail. If I do, eventually the win will come, and I only need to win big, once.</p>
<p>Find your calling. The reason why God put you on this earth. The superpowers He gave you. The things that you&rsquo;re naturally good at and that you love to do. It&rsquo;s ok if you&rsquo;re not the best and no matter what you do there will always be aspects that challenge you.</p>
<p>But the growth is in the challenges.</p>
<p>Step outside your comfort zone just enough to grow a little, and become your truest self.</p>
<p>Follow your heart and soul.</p>
