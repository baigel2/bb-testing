<p><em>Our entire universe could be the 3 dimensional surface of a four dimensional hypersphere!</em></p>
<p>Or at least thats one hypothesis going around in the scientific communities of the world.</p>
<p>You could think of it like the 2d surface of a football for example. There is no center of the surface of a football. Sure there&rsquo;s a center of the football itself, inside it, but not the surface.</p>
<h2 id="an-experiment-you-can-do-at-home">An experiment you can do at home.</h2>
<p>Take a marker and place a dot anywhere on a spherical object like a football or a tennis ball for example.</p>
<p>Now measure the distance in all directions around it till you come back to that dot. No matter where you place the dot, the distance around the surface of the ball in any direction will always be the same.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do this with a 2 dimensional shape like a square or circle for example, because those shapes have edges so depending on where you placed the dot the distances to those edges would be different in different directions, and that means those 2 dimensional shapes do have a centre.</p>
<p>(If however you turned a paper square over for example, to continue measuring it you could arrive back at the dot but then you&rsquo;d be utilising the 3rd dimention, which would be cheating, and then you&rsquo;d have to go sit on the naughty step! XD)</p>
<p>Well, the same thing happens with 3d objects in the 3rd dimention.</p>
<p>Around the surface the measurements will always be the same but if you were to levitate a dot somewhere inside the ball, you would get different measurements depending on where you place the dot because there are edges (the balls surface) that stop you from looping back to the dot.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-why-scientists-think-there-is-no-center-of-the-universe">This is why scientists think there is no center of the universe.</h2>
<p>It could be the surface of a 4 dimentional hypersphere and as were on the surface, if we were to contiuously measure in any direction from any place in the universe the measurements would be the same.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This idea is further supported by the fact that, wherever you place yourself in the universe, the other galaxies no matter what direction you look in are almost always moving away from you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like how if you were to bake some chocolate chip muffins and watch them in the oven, you would see that, as the muffin expands most, if not all of the chocolate chips would be moving away from each other and if you shrunk yourself and stood on the surface of the mufin as this was happening, regardless of where you stood on the muffins surface and which direction you looked across its surface, the other chips would always be moving away from you.</p>
<p>So the 2d surface of the muffin expands in proportion to the 3d expansion of the muffins interior.</p>
<p>This is what some scientists think could be happening to our universe. That it could be the 3d surface of a 4d bubble that&rsquo;s expanding outwards in all directions.</p>
<p>Is your mind thoroughly boggled now or what!?</p>
<p>The nature of reality is something I think most if not all people find interesting and question sometimes and hypotheses like these really illustrate how infinite the possibilities could be.</p>
<p>Later in this series I&rsquo;ll be exploring the nature of reality and how we percieve it so stay tuned for that!</p>

<p>Also, I have a poetry book! It&rsquo;s published <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/3nzHMT6">here</a> on Amazon and free to read if you&rsquo;re a kindle unlimited subscriber. Kindle unlimited authors get paid based on how many pages are read.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can buy the ebook for £1.99 from the UK site, the prices will vary if you&rsquo;re in a different part of the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving 50% profits to charity: 25% Palestine and 25% to the Uyghur Muslims of Turkestan. A further 25% of profits will go towards other projects i&rsquo;m working on that will raise more money for people in need.</p>

<p>There is a limit to how far we can see into space based on the time it takes for light to reach us however this does not mean that this barrier is necessarily the edge of the universe, it&rsquo;s simply the upper limits of what we can observe, which is why you&rsquo;ll often hear scientists use the term &rsquo;the observable universe'.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
