      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A little about the series:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everything that exists, had a beginning. I wonder, what was the beginning of music? It&amp;rsquo;s history predates writing and it&amp;rsquo;s influence is capable of creating phisical and phsychological changes in the the mind soul and body. Music can make you laugh, cry, rage, dream, focus, relax and bounce around like a donkey on crack.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So where did it come from?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You wanna know something crazy? It even predates humans. Don&amp;rsquo;t believe me?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the alarm goes off and I’m lying in bed after a half day at work I think, maybe I should do iftaar at home today. There’s a programme on at the mosque with English lectures every evening after prayers and iftaar and the mosque is a stones throw from where I work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I’m reminded of two things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yesterdays talk focussed heavily on discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something I’ve learnt at an intellectual level at least is, the times when you least want to are the times when you most have to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thinking about money.</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-long-long-time-ago-in-a-galaxy-far-far-away&#34;&gt;A long long time ago in a galaxy far far away….&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ok, not that long ago, but still. When I was a teenager I went through, (perhaps like most teenagers?) a philosophy phase. I looked into different religions and as you might guess got pretty into buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started meditating and even got to a point where I managed to empty my mind of all (conscious) thought.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But aside from philosophising over spiritual matters I was also thinking quite a lot about worldly matters. Like, what if the medicine industry was actually not in favour of curing all diseases?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What if the middle path is the extreme?</title>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Picture this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The alarm goes off and you leap out of bed turning it off mid flight. Your towel is hanging ready and you head into the shower to start your day with a 0 kelvin shower. No breakfast. Food is for cowards. Your food must be earned with blood sweat and pushups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Am I sounding Gogginsey yet? Tatey?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thing is, if you&amp;rsquo;re the most disciplined person in the world for just one day it won&amp;rsquo;t make a difference. Towards the end of 2022 I gave myself a 100 day discipline challenge. I exercised and maintained more discipline over the course of that experiment than I ever had before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Worship. It isn&#39;t what you think.</title>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I did not create jinn and humans except to worship Me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At first glance this seems like a very self centered, selfish statement. &amp;ldquo;Why is God so selfish?&amp;rdquo; a non believer might say. I certenly thought this when I was an atheist. And it does seem selfish until you do one of two things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Look at the very next few verses.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consider the nature and effects of what Allah defines as worship.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The verse above is &lt;a href=&#34;https://quran.com/en/adh-dhariyat/56-58&#34;&gt;Surah Adh-Dhariyat, verse 56&lt;/a&gt; if you look at verses 57 and 58 they read:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Discipline. Discipline?</title>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Discipline. Many people have a romantic idea of discipline. The warriors path. Overcome the self. Constantly at war, swimming against the currents, pushing back against the winds. Diving head first into the waters of discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is that the only way? Is that the only way to progress in life? By Grinding? Is it not possible to sail?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What if it is?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do I have to be the next Jockko or Goggins? NO! In fact, that&amp;rsquo;s about the dumbest idea I could ever possibly have! Goggins is Goggins, Jockko is Jockko and God made me Adnan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-i-love-apple-as-a-former-linux-user&#34;&gt;Why I love apple as a former linux user.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Linux. It&amp;rsquo;s an operating system I love very much. Or at least I love the idea of linux. The idea that you can own your computer and do whatever you want with it, change it completely to your liking and use it however you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a great idea in principle but there are some hangups. You see, theres a difference between being able to do everything yourself and having to do everything yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Buddha In The Storm</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One day some years ago I asked myself, what would the enlightened version of me look like? I imagined another version of me in a Buddhist monks robes, sitting down meditating in front of a white picket fence with a tornado raging around me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite that tornado being there and being very capable of killing me, this Enlightened version of me just sat there calm as anything, meditating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I have already mentioned this Buddha in the storm in &lt;a href=&#34;https://baigelbytes.netlify.app/blog/mh2/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post but this superpower is just to great not to share again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
