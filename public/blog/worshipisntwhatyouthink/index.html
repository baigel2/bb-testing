<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I did not create jinn and humans except to worship Me.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>At first glance this seems like a very self centered, selfish statement. &ldquo;Why is God so selfish?&rdquo; a non believer might say. I certenly thought this when I was an atheist. And it does seem selfish until you do one of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look at the very next few verses.</li>
<li>Consider the nature and effects of what Allah defines as worship.</li>
</ol>
<p>The verse above is <a href="https://quran.com/en/adh-dhariyat/56-58">Surah Adh-Dhariyat, verse 56</a> if you look at verses 57 and 58 they read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>57: &ldquo;I seek no provision from them, nor do I need them to feed Me.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>58: &ldquo;Indeed, Allah ˹alone˺ is the Supreme Provider—Lord of all Power, Ever Mighty.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>If our Creator does not need us for anything why does he want our worship? To answer that, we need to look at what worship is and what worship does both for us and for Him.</p>
<p>What does worship do for God? Absolutely nothing. It does not benefit Him one aiota. How can anything benefit the Source and Creator of benefit?</p>
<p>Well in that case, what does worship do for us? EV - RY - THING!</p>
<p>Imagine for a moment that the world was taken over by a dictator and that this dictator demanded everyone on earth worship him. &ldquo;Go to hell&rdquo; most people would think to themselves. But what if every act of worship that he demanded from us actually benefitted us and not him?</p>
<p>What if he demanded we be as fit and healthy as we could be, that we prosper so much that no one on earth remained poor or needy. That we looked after ourselves and our families and enjoyed our time on earth as best we could?</p>
<p>What kind of dictator would that be? Would &lsquo;dictator&rsquo; even fit?</p>
<p>Well this is how it is with God. Except <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2023%3A19&amp;version=NKJV">God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent.</a> (- Numbers 23:19) Allah or <a href="https://www.videobible.com/aramaic-word-for-god#:~:text=The%20Aramaic%20word%20for%20%E2%80%9CGod,during%20the%20time%20of%20Jesus.">Ellaha</a> as He is was known in the Aramaeic of Jesus Christ PBUH, Is not a man but the creator of man.</p>
<p>Everything that Allah defines as worship is actually something that benefits us either in this life or the next, or more often both.</p>
<p>Prayer? As the body needs food, the soul needs prayer. Prayer isn&rsquo;t just asking God for a shiny new Lamborghini and a house on the beach, or good results on your exams. Prayer is the primary way that we build and maintain a connection with our maker.</p>
<p>Christians. Imagine the best Church service you&rsquo;ve ever been to. One where you felt so close to God you were literally reduced to tears in gratitude and love for The Almighty. Imagine feeling like that everyday.</p>
<p>In Islam, it&rsquo;s possible through the five daily prayers. You should know already that a connection to our Maker is more important to maintain than food, water and even air. A dead soul is far worse than a dead body.</p>
<p>Well, this is why prayers are made obligatory in Islam. God DEMANDS that we stay alive, body mind <strong>and</strong> soul. That we stay healthy by eating halal which is essentially kosher with slightly fewer restrictions.</p>
<p>God demands that we look after ourselves and our families by earning an honest living. Interest is forbidden because it takes advantage of the weak and poor and widens the wealth gap. There was a time in Islamic history in Medina where the city was so prosperous there were no poor people to give charity to.</p>
<p>Instead they had to send the charity out to other cities that needed it. This is how much Allah want&rsquo;s us to prosper not just in this world but the next. He wants us to prosper and be as healthy as we can be and to look after each other and do good, to have patience and faith, and to what end? He wants us in heaven.</p>
<p>What kind of worship is this? That it&rsquo;s something you choose willingly and that leads to the best of all places?</p>
<p>What kind of Maker is He, that wants all this benefit for you?</p>
<p>The Most Wise, Most Kind, Most Loving, Most High Lord of all the worlds.</p>
<p>Worship isn&rsquo;t what you think. Worship is everything you need to get to heaven. A gift, from The Owner of Mercy.</p>
